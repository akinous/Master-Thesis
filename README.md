Reliable malaria diagnosis techniques that are suitable for testing in high burden
areas, are vital for effective treatment and monitoring of the disease. Identification
of malaria parasites in Giemsa stained blood slides is currently the most widely
accepted technique, but its availability is limited by the need for highly trained experts to interpret the data.This thesis presents a machine learning approach for the
automated detection and classification of malaria-infected Red blood cells (RBCs)
.The object detection stage utilizes YoloV7 algorithm to detect RBCs in thin blood
smear images which is show to have the least inference time while preserving high
accuracy. The classification stage utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network, the architecture of which is based on LRNet, with adaptations and improvements made
for this use case. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using
different datasets of thin blood smear images and compared with the existing state
of the art approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the speed and accuracy of malaria diagnosis while having high generalizability
,specificity and sensitivity.
